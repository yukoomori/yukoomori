## About Myself
Welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Yuko Ohmori, and I am currently working at Deloitte as an IT Consultant. I mainly code in Python on Kaggle and SIGNATE (a japanese data science competition platform). Please have a look at my profile there as well! ([Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/yohmori02), [SIGNATE profile](https://signate.jp/users/74597))

On this page, I have accumulated a few projects that I have worked on. Projects include Natural Language Processing in Japanese (Janome/MeCab) and English (NLTK) as well as Imagine Classification (CNN Keras).
