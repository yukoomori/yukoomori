## About Myself
Welcome to my GitHub page! My name is Yuko Ohmori, and I am a ex-Deloitte Data Scientist, currently working as an AI Engineer (contract worker) with clients such as Softbank. I have done several projects in a variety of industries, ranging from industrial machinary classification problems to healthcare NLP solutions to solar panel energy time series prediction. I periodically publish some of my work on this Github page. Outside of work, I mainly code in Python on Kaggle (Expert) and SIGNATE (a japanese data science competition platform). Please have a look at my profile there as well! ([Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/yohmori02), [SIGNATE profile](https://signate.jp/users/74597))
